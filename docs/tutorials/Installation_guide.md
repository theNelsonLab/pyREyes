# REyes â€“ Automated Electron Diffraction Software
## Installation Guide

REyes is a software suite that allows for fully autonomous microED (microcrystal electron diffraction) data acquisition and processing. REyes was designed to be executed on two computers: (i) acquisition PC and (ii) processing PC. Thus, installation consists of two parts:

- pyREyes package installation on the processing PC
- SerialEM configuration on the acquisition PC

## Prerequisites

For installation and operation to run smoothly:

- **Processing PC** should have Python installed. In this installation guide Python is installed through micromamba as an example. Other Python installations will suffice. Processing PC also requires a working installation of [XDS](https://xds.mr.mpg.de) for data reduction and [SHELX](https://shelx.uni-goettingen.de) for phasing. Please follow the installation instructions provided by each respective source. pyREyes has been most extensively tested using Linux and macOS systems, as well as Linux terminal on Windows (WSL). Cross-platform libraries used for the development will allow it to operate natively on Windows, however, XDS data reduction package requires a UNIX operating system.

- **Acquisition PC** should have an installed and calibrated SerialEM. Note that REyes has been developed and tested using SerialEM 4.1.

### Suggested Processing PC Configuration

**Hardware:**
- CPU: Intel Core i7-5820K @ 3.30GHz
- RAM: 16 GB (lower memory will result in slow down of grid atlas processing step)

**Operating System:**
- Preferred: Linux (latest Ubuntu 24 LTS)
- Optional: Windows 10 Version 1607 that can run WSL Ubuntu 24 LTS

**Apple Silicon Mac:**
- REyes has been tested on Mac with M3 and M4 Apple Silicon processors running latest macOS Sequoia 15

Follow this guide to install the REyes suite.

## Part 1: Processing PC

### Installation Steps

1. Download pyREyes package from the Nelson Lab GitHub repository: https://github.com/theNelsonLab/pyREyes

2. In terminal, UNIX or WSL, create a new Python environment by running and follow prompt instructions:

```bash
micromamba create -n reyes_env python=3.12 -c conda-forge
```

3. Change directory to the downloaded pyREyes package, activate the environment and install the package locally:

```bash
cd /your/path/to/downloaded/pyREyes-main
micromamba activate reyes_env
pip install .
```

### Verification

Test the installation by running:

```bash
python -c "import pyREyes; print('pyREyes installation successful')"
```

This step concludes installation of pyREyes. Note that AutoProcess 2.0 (https://github.com/theNelsonLab/autoprocess) is one of the dependencies and will be installed automatically, while AutoSolve is still under development and can be obtained from the developers via email until it becomes public later this year.

## Part 2: Acquisition PC

### Configure SerialEM Low Dose

Configure SerialEM Low Dose as follows:

- **Autosave log** is off
- **Eucentricity in Search** is off
- **Low Dose View** is LM magnification
  - E.g. 210x for CETA-D (Talos Arctica)
  - E.g. 155x for DE Apollo (Talos F200C)
- **Low Dose Record** is DIFFRACTION under parallel beam condition
  - E.g. 960 mm with 50 um condenser aperture for CETA-D (Talos Arctica)
  - E.g. 420 mm with 50 um condenser aperture for DE Apollo (Talos F200C)

### Other Suggested Settings

- **Low Dose Focus** is SA magnification ca. 22000x
- **Low Dose Search** is SA magnification ca. 4300x under parallel beam condition identical to Record mode

### Script Configuration

Depending on the available camera, replace SerialEMsettings-scripts.txt file path in SerialEMsettings.txt with one of provided templates. The line to be changed is line 3 of the SerialEMsettings.txt file.

```
SerialEMSettings
SystemPath     C:\ProgramData\SerialEM\
ScriptPackagePath      C:\ProgramData\SerialEM\Scripts\SerialEMsettings-scripts-Apollo.txt
```

This step concludes configuration of SerialEM for REyes. Note that minor adjustments of microscope settings and SerialEM scripts might be required to tailor a particular system.
